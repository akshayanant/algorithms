 * Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

 Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

 Example 1:

 Input:     1         1
 / \       / \
 2   3     2   3

 [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]

 Output: true

        if (p == null || q == null) {
            return p == null && q == null;
        }
        return p.val == q.val && isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
    }
}
